As it has been a while since we had a general meeting (and there have
been a number of changes since then) it is time to have another one.
Specifically, we should focus on the continued survival of the DimSumLabs.

I propose a meeting for 19:30 on Wed 18th October.  I also propose that
this meeting be limited to a maximum of 2 hours.

As per a decision from our last meeting, we will have the agenda published
seven days prior to the meeting.  I am happy to accept submissions for
agenda items and will collate them and publish them to the members mailing
list.

It is expected there will not be time to address all the proposed agenda
items and thus, once the agenda has been published we can all prioritise
their order (this could be done as the first thing at the meeting, but
it might be more efficient to do it beforehand).  Any agenda items that
do not get discussed can simply be added to the proposed list for any
future meeting.

In order to try and make the meeting go as quickly as possible, I will
be asking that any submitted agenda item be accompanied by a description
(of one to three paragraphs) - to be published at the same time as the
agenda - so that everyone can be on the same page to start any discussions.
