This is the interim document for meeting agenda items.  The order of the
agenda items is purely a suggestion until the pre-meeting prioritisation
step has occured.

Pre meeting trivia:

0.1.  Are we all agreed that there is a quorum present?
0.2.  Nominate a meeting chairperson and minute taker
0.3.  State to all that this meeting will be held under the Chatham House Rule
0.4.  Prioritise the agenda items (if not done before the meeting)
      and join together any that are obviously the same.

1. HKMake Ltd

1.1. Financial Health (proposed by: hamish)

Quick report on the current financial situation

1.2. Decide on the future of DimSumLabs

At the last meeting, we determined that the funding for DimSumLabs was a
serious issue and that we all needed to put effort into trying to turn
things around.

Questions for discussion:
- Have we seen any turnaround in the finances?
- Do we have enough data to make a decision about the future?

Remembering that we probably only have until the end of Jan to make any
final decisions.
