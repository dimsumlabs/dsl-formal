At our last general meeting, we decided that we needed to meet again
soon to check on the health and continued survival of the DimSumLabs.

We agreed to meet at 20:00 on Wed 6th December.  This meeting will be
limited to 2 hours.

As usual, we will have the agenda published seven days prior to the
meeting.  I am happy to accept submissions for agenda items and will
publish them in the https://github.com/dimsumlabs/dsl-formal repository

In order to try and make the meeting go as quickly as possible, I will
be asking that any submitted agenda item be accompanied by a description
(of one to three paragraphs) - to be published at the same time as the
agenda - so that everyone can be on the same page to start any discussions.
